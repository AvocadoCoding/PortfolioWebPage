# PortfolioWebPage

## Project Summary
I have created a portfolio web page to introduce myself to anyone who may be interested in my coding experience and project portfolio. In this web page I provide a brief introduction to myself, links to key projects I have worked on and my contact and GitHub details. I can then provide a link to this webpage to parties such as potential employers or colleagues to provide an overview my work. The web page itself is an advertisement for my coding and so has tto be visual appealing, well laid out and adaptible to different viewports.

To create this web page I used HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling. I created a navigation bar linking to different sections of the page, a dividing banner for the site aesthetics, an 'about me' section with my photograph and brief introduction, a 'work' section with links to projects (currently 'dead' links) of which one project stands out with a larger image and button, and a 'Contact Me' section with my contact details and link to my GitHub repository. I used flexbox commands for much of the webpage, as a way to give a flexible and orgnaised website structure. I used grid commands for the project buttons in the 'work' section as a convenient way to create that layout. I also used media commands to restructure the web page for narrower screen widths, to maintain the aesthetics in different viewports. In particular I put the main page section flex function to 'column' and made the grid part into a single column format on narrower viewports; other minor fomratting changes like centering elements and removing the nav bar on the narrowest screens were also included for aesthetic benefit.

I have also used semantic HTML, arranged the code semantically and included an 'alt' description on my headshot image- this will make the website easier to read when using a screeen reader, and makes the code easier to follow. I have also added comments to clearly explain the code, to make it easy to understand for myself when I come back to it or for anyone else looking at the code.

# Original Challenge--> Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Your Task

This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 
 
With these points in mind, in this challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It’s a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

**Note:** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
